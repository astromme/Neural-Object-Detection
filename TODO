Stromme's Todo:
    add a getBlankPoint() class to base source class
    rename generators to sources

Thoughts on what we want to do
------------------------------

* greyscale
* color representation (rgb, hsv, hsl)
* make physical distance more important
  ==> +1.5 x,y distance
* focus on high-error areas/boundaries
* object tracking
  ==> Using AIBO
* initial object choice
* process a 'movie' (multiple frames)
  ==> ability to pause
* color networks of nodes based on the subgraph

What we want for final presentation
-----------------------------------
+ * object tracking in movie
+ * use webcam to demo tracking
* be able to specify initial object choice
  ==> command-line option
  ==> OR click on it..
* setup 'scene'
  ==> adapt to changes in lighting
    -- lights on, off
    -- shades up, down
  ==> adapt to changes in motion
    -- moving water bottle
    -- objects of same color, big/small following

Presentation Outline
--------------------
* Introduce Project
  ==> High-level goals
* GNG Background
* Inputs to GNG
  ==> Color model
* Hypothesis (?)
  ==> make clear what our program can do
  ==> what do/did we think will happen
  ==> why is GNG a good tool to use
* Specific Techniques (that worked)
    -- show distinct effects of each technique
    -- how they work
  ==> focus
  ==> distance
* Demo
  ==> see 'scene' above
* Future work (we have two weeks!)
